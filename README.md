# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at [some examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Version History

Password_generator_v1.0 - Initial commit; Used provided homework layout for index.html, script.js & style.css.

Password_generator_v1.1 - Removed header and added nav bar element to replace it, for styling the top of the page (index.html lines 12-14); Added bootstrap link above css link (index.html line 11).

Password_generator_v1.2 - Removed existing content and replaced with content I have been developing on the side (index.html lines 27-48). Changes include, different text window where password will be displayed (line 32); Added checkbox elements for password criteria selection (lines 35-38); Added slider element for user control of password length/ complexity; also created "onclick" function call for slider (line 41); Added buttons for password generation and for copying the password to clipboard; also created "onclick" function calls for each button (lines 44, 46).

Password_generator_v1.3 - Added sticky footer with version info to bottom of page (index.html lines 57-61); Removed unused CSS lines and added footer related styling (styles.css lines 1-3, 34, 39-52); Changed card background-color to lightgray and the top padding for wrapper div element to 20px (styles.css line 16, 23).

Password_generator_v1.4 - Changed password display and slider styles to extend to 100% of the page (style.css lines 38, 42).  

Password_generator_v1.5 - Removed existing script, and initialized variable "complexity" which keeps track of the slider's value (to be used) to set password length; the value of "complexity" is displyed in the empty div element after the slider (index.html line 48) as "Length: " + complexity (script.js lines 2-10); 

Password_generator_v1.6 - Created function genPass() which is called on the "generate" button click. In its curent form, it uses a sigle char array "genPassVals" along with a math.random loop to create a random password of length "complexity"; The password is stored in the variable "password" during the loop and is pushed into the text display immediatle after loop execution (script.js lines 15-27). 

Password_generator_v1.7 - Added functionality to the checkboxes, so that when selected they pass different character arrays to "genPassVals". Selecting more than one checkbox concatinates the sring of characters selected; however, if no selections are made, an alert is provided to the user and we exit the entire genPass function call (script.js lines 18-50).

Password_generator_v1.8 - Added second card for previously generated passwords to be displayed (index.html lines 54-65); Added functionality to add previously generated passwords within genPass function (script.js line 64).
